It manages to be both a “nudie mag”, and a home for the writings of literary greats like Margaret Atwood, Kurt Vonnegut, Haruki Murakami and Joyce Carol Oates.</p><p>It’s broken boundaries and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hugh-hefners-surprising-civil-rights-legacy" target="_blank">seen itself as activists</a>, while others have described its output as setting women back by centuries.</p><p>Taking it from a kitchen in a Chicago apartment to a landmark mansion in Beverly Hills, Playboy’s founder Hugh Hefner, a figure both vilified and praised, turned it into a cultural icon that would come to influence the world for more than 65 years. Along the way, even the Supreme Court has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Playboy_Entertainment_Group,_Inc." target="_blank">had to contend with it</a>.</p><p>A casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the physical print of the magazine <a href="https://medium.com/naked-open-letters-from-playboy/an-open-letter-to-our-team-and-partners-b859b1a4c663" target="_blank">ended in the spring of 2020</a>, and in 2021 Playboy stopped picking the iconic Playmate of the Month.</p><p>Under the surface, looking at the data of Playmates reveals a more fundamental change happening behind the scenes. Slowly, quietly and without much notice - a <em>paradigm shift</em>. <strong>Since Hefner’s death, Playboy has been redefining how it beholds beauty</strong>.</p><p>How did Playboy view beauty over the years, and where is the trend headed now?</p><p class="css-s0gr9"><p>⚠️ There are mentions of body measurements, and some content in this article might be triggering to those who have current or past experiences with disordered eating or body dysmorphia.</p></p><p>Since the first issue in December 1953, Playboy picked the Playmate of the Month <strong>812 times</strong>, featuring <strong>806 unique women</strong>. Playmates are featured in what’s known as the “centerfold” of the magazine, where the pages have no break between them. Since 2021, the “Playmate of the Month” title is no longer awarded, and a Playmate is picked every quarter.</p><p>While we look at the data for Playmates, it’s important to remember that there are real human beings behind this data. Through the years, Playmates have been admired, but more often vilified for their work in what is essentially the sex industry. The cultural, political and religious framing around sexuality and beauty has a way of clouding judgments — and while the data points serve as a clarifying lens — we need to be careful about reducing these humans to a handful of numbers. This particular set of numbers serve as anchors so we can talk about beauty as it’s perceived by Playboy, limited as they might be in describing <em>actual</em> beauty.</p><p> Show data units in <button> feet, inches, pounds </button>  or <button> centimetres, kilograms </button></p><div class="css-hc6lm9"><div class="css-b8nvy2"><div style="height: 100%; width: 100%;"></div></div><div class="css-1c0ckme"><div class="css-yuildg"><p>The pink dots represent each individual Playmate of the Month. Click or Tap the circles at any point to get more information about them.</p><p>There were 7 issues where multiple Playmates appeared at the same time. They’re shown as clusters in the same month.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> was the first ever “Sweetheart of the Month”, before the introduction of the Playmate of the Month title. Hugh Hefner had bought previously unpublished nude photos of her for a calendar, and picked the “sexiest” picture for the first centerfold. Although she was not the copyright holder, Ms. Monroe did not consent to those images’ use and she reportedly was not compensated.</p><p>The hype around her appearance catapulted the magazine to success right from the start.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p>In March of 1955, the staff couldn’t meet the deadlines to deliver the issue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060326233118/http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/collecting.html#4" target="_blank">so nothing was released</a>.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p><strong>Jennifer Jackson</strong>, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/exclusive-interview-playmate-jennifer-jackson_n_980502" target="_blank">model and now a social worker from Chicago</a> was the first Black Playmate ever to be featured in the magazine.</p><p>This was a time at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement#Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965" target="_blank">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> would be introduced only months later.</p><p>Later, Playboy <a href="https://twitter.com/Playboy/status/921155223745306624" target="_blank">tweeted some of the angry letters they received</a> after featuring a Black Playmate.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p>In November 2017, <strong>Ines Rau</strong> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/20/entertainment/ines-rau-playboy/index.html" target="_blank">became the first openly transgender Playmate</a> in the history of the magazine.</p><p>This was however her second appearance, her first image in May of 2014 was titled “Evolution”.</p><p>After backlash, Playboy <a href="https://twitter.com/Playboy/status/921155850269536256" target="_blank">tweeted their support</a> for this decision with the caption: “Standing on the right side of history”.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p><strong>Marsha Elle</strong> is a singer-songwriter and a motivational speaker based out of Miami. She was born with <em>proximal femoral focal deficiency</em> which required the amputation of her right leg, and she’s had a prosthetic leg since 5 years old. After struggling with insecurity for most of her life – she didn’t wear shorts until the age of 23! – <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/playboy-playmate-marsha-elle" target="_blank">she became the first amputee Playmate</a>.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p>Here are some of the other “firsts” in Playmate history.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><p><strong>Karen McDougal</strong> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal" target="_blank">made headlines</a> when the story of her alleged affair with Donald Trump broke in the media 4 days before the 2016 election.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>End of an Era</h2><p>Hugh Hefner passed away on September 27, 2017. It’s reported that he had been personally involved in picking Playmates of the Month, and the data below suggests that the characteristics of who gets picked have started changing significantly after his death.</p><p>Even though it’s evident that Playboy has often been progressive, this also highlights some of the biases that he might have reinforced through his personal touch.</p><p>While Hefner had his fans, it is known that many of those who worked with him did not have a positive experience, and <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/every-former-playmate-whos-spoken-out-against-hugh-hefner/" target="_blank">a lot of Playmates have spoken out against him</a>.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Age</h2><p>There has been a dramatic <strong>increase of about 4 years</strong> in the ages of Playmates since the first issue.</p><p>Note the highlighted area in red. 8 Playmates, up until 1981 were under the age of 18 when photographed. This would be a felony today. Wikipedia quotes, <em>“in the early years of the magazine, laws regarding corruption of a minor were less well established.”</em></p><p>There is the interesting story of one Playmate, who was photographed at the age of 16. Hugh Hefner and the Playmate’s mother were arrested, but the case was dismissed after they found that her mother had signed a statement saying that her daughter was 18.</p><p>The names of these individuals are not included in this article.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Height</h2><p>Playmates have always been taller than the average American woman, but they have gotten even taller through time, about a <strong>5% increase</strong> since 1954.</p><p>The average height of women in the US was 5'4" or 162.6 cm <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03-046-508.pdf" target="_blank">between 2015-2018</a>.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Weight</h2><blockquote class="css-1ye69a3"><p style="margin: 0px;">It was a competition because you couldn't gain any weight. They watched your weight, they watched your appearance, and no one paid you a salary.</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/exclusive-interview-playmate-jennifer-jackson_n_980502#:~:text=It%20was%20competition%20because%20you%20couldn%27t%20gain%20any%20weight.%20They%20watched%20your%20weight%2C%20they%20watched%20your%20appearance%2C%20and%20no%20one%20paid%20you%20a%20salary." target="_blank">Jennifer Jackson</a></p></blockquote><p>Weight has similarly seen an <strong>increase of about 8%</strong>. What is striking is how the average model weight sharply strays from the prior average after Hefner's death, strongly suggesting Hefner favored women of a certain, smaller size.</p><p><strong>Ali Chanel</strong> is an obvious outlier, and a welcome one for body positivity. Dubbed “Playboy’s curviest Playmate,” she has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ali-chanel-playboy-playmate" target="_blank">encouraged</a> others to accept their bodies as they are.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Bust</h2><p>There has been a significant drop in bust sizes, <strong>9.6% decrease</strong> overall. This is interesting, because most sources online claim that bust size, especially in the US, has actually <em>gone up</em>, but without citing clear sources. This divergence highlights yet another contradictory nature of Playboy.</p><p>Between September 2012 until Hefner’s death, there was an inexplicable upper cap on bust size. We start seeing huge variance once again, like the early days, after his death.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Waist</h2><p>The most significant change among body measurements is the waist, with an <strong>11% increase</strong>. Playmates with much larger waist measurements started being featured especially after 2017. About 13% of the women were above 28”/71.2 cm after Hefner’s death, compared to <1% up until that time.</p><p>Even with that, the average waist measurement of women in the US was 36.3" or 92.1 cm between 2015–2018. If we plot it on this graph, it would extend beyond the top axis. In other words, <strong>no Playmate has ever been at the US average for waist measurement</strong>.</p><p>Having a smaller waist is the most statistically significant distinction between Playmates and the US average.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Hips</h2><p>Yet another example of explosion of variance after Hefner’s death, hip measurements have seen a <strong>minor 2% increase</strong>, yet most of that increase is carried by the post-2017 Playmates with much higher measurements than in the history of the magazine.</p><p>In fact, 20% of the Playmates had larger hips than at any other point in the magazine’s history after Hefner’s death.</p><p>This minor increase suggests that while post-Hefner era Playboy favors a wider variety of models on a variety of fronts, a small waist remains standard.</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Hair color</h2><p>What do you think of when you think of hair color in the context of Playboy magazine? If you're like me, you think "blond".</p><p>The truth is that there is almost equal representation of brown and blond hair, but black hair is underrepresented.</p><p>A study in 2003 reported that only 4% of adults in the US are naturally blond, and so we see a huge overrepresentation of blonds.</p><p>Clearly, having light hair has become the “beauty standard”, as <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=3asbkganD14C&q=What+percent+of+adults+are+naturally+blond%3F&pg=PA52&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=What%20percent%20of%20adults%20are%20naturally%20blond%3F&f=false" target="_blank">48% of White college women dyed their hair blond or </a><a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=3asbkganD14C&q=What+percent+of+adults+are+naturally+blond%3F&pg=PA52&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=What%20percent%20of%20adults%20are%20naturally%20blond%3F&f=false" target="_blank">blonder</a>, higher than any other color. This might also be a reason why black hair is underrepresented.</p><p>Could the dominant cultural force of Playboy be influencing some of the choices made by college-aged women, even if indirectly? And in that vein, to what extent is Playboy an aspirational publication?</p></div><div class="css-oeeryf"><h2>Cosmetic Enhancements</h2><p>Essential to the conversation surrounding Playboy’s view of beauty is the lengths that many individuals went to achieve it. Cosmetic enhancements by way of surgical procedures are quite common among models who became Playmates.</p><p>In this case, we can clearly see that enhanced breasts came into prominence starting around 1985 and peaked around 2010s before fading away again. This is doubly interesting when you consider that bust sizes have steadily gone down over the years.</p></div><div class="css-1279t05"><h2>Ethnicity</h2><p>Despite featuring a Black Playmates early in their publication, historically, Playboy undoubtedly prefers white women. The magazine reinforced the standard of beauty in America as largely limited to the domain of white women, with 90% of its Playmates being white. It featured a single Black woman for the first time in 1965, and it did not feature a Black woman again for four years. This pattern suggests a standard of beauty that does not represent the diversity of the country, and the stark underrepresentation is striking.</p><p>Playboy’s exclusion of BIPOC individuals from its pages suggests that their vision of beauty fits squarely within the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/02/06/685506578/is-beauty-in-the-eyes-of-the-colonizer" target="_blank">colonizer perspective</a> and constructs the “All American Beauty” as a blond, skinny white woman. This impacts more than just their readers, as the “blast radius” of its influence continues to negatively impact BIPOC communities, especially young women, and will likely continue to harm them for years to come.</p><p>Also, despite their progressive image, only 2019 and 2020 had 40% non-white Playmates, the most it has ever been in its 67-year history.
