It manages to be both a “nudie mag” and a home for the writings of literary greats like Margaret Atwood, Kurt Vonnegut, Haruki Murakami, and Joyce Carol Oates.</p><p>In its heyday, it was <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hugh-hefners-surprising-civil-rights-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen by some as revolutionary</a>, while now others say it’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41426299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firmly stuck in the past</a>. While being the harbinger of the sexual revolution and claiming to be a part of the feminist movement, it aggressively pursued a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41426299#:~:text=He%20did%20not%20empower%20women.%20He%20gave%20them%20just%20one%20more%20restrictive%20role%20to%20choose%20from." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rigid role for women</a>, and a strictly heterosexual one, even in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_liberation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gay Liberation Movement</a> of the ’60s.</p><p>Taking the magazine from a Chicago apartment to a mansion in Beverly Hills, Playboy’s founder Hugh Hefner, a figure both vilified and praised, turned the brand into a cultural icon that would come to influence the American male gaze, for better or for worse, for more than 65 years.</p><p>But how well has the Playboy gaze reflected the wider spectrum of American life? One of the publication’s longest-running contradictions, that it could call for sexual liberation while maintaining a very restrictive definition of beauty, seems to now be crumbling. <strong>Since Hefner’s death in 2017, Playboy has been redefining how it beholds beauty</strong>.</p><p>Looking at the data on the Playmate of the Month feature (a title that was retired in 2021), and grounding it in the cultural context of the last several decades, we can begin to understand how Playboy has viewed beauty historically, and where it’s headed now.</p></div><p style="background-color: var(--color-warning); padding: 0.5rem 1rem; color: var(--color-text); max-width: 100%;"><p>⚠️ There are mentions of body measurements, and some content in this article might be triggering to those who have current or past experiences with disordered eating or body dysmorphia.</p></p><div><p>Since the first issue in December 1953, Playboy picked the Playmate of the Month <strong>812 times</strong>, featuring <strong>806 unique women</strong>. Playmates are featured in what’s known as the “centerfold,” the middle pages of a magazine made up of a single photo or feature story. The centerfold was followed by the “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=playmate+data+sheet&tbm=isch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playmate Data Sheet</a>,” a handwritten section penned by the Playmates where they would document their measurements, share notes about their lives and feature photos from their youth.</p><p>As we look at the data for Playmates, it’s important to remember that there are real human beings behind this data. The Data Sheet could be seen as an attempt to avoid the dehumanized sexual objectification of the women featured. This particular set of numbers serves as anchors to talk about beauty as perceived by Playboy, limited as they might be in describing <em>actual</em> beauty.</p></div><p> Show data units in <button class="unit-picker-button active"> feet, inches, pounds </button>  or <button class="unit-picker-button false"> centimetres, kilograms </button></p><div style="position: relative;"><div style="position: sticky; top: 10vh; height: 80vh; width: 95vw; margin: 0 auto; z-index: 0;"><div style="height: 100%; width: 100%;"></div></div><div style="max-width: 40ch; z-index: 1; position: relative; pointer-events: none; display: flex; flex-direction: column;" class="scrolly-text"><div style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid white; margin-bottom: 90vh; pointer-events: all; padding: 0 1rem;"><div style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.7rem; color: var(--color-text);">1/17</div><div><p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> was the first-ever “Sweetheart of the Month” before the introduction of the Playmate of the Month title.

The world in which Playmates lived, a reality that was masterfully cropped out of photoshoots and public relations campaigns, has started to be reflected in the types of women featured. It has changed Playboy’s beauty standards ever so slightly, but it is a more inclusive shift nonetheless. One question remains to be answered: is this shift towards inclusion sincere or merely performative? Many a brand has made an effort to be more inclusive in their messaging but often fall short. A giveaway here is that this change has been led by primarily white models. The body positivity movement in Playboy — as is also the case in many other areas — has been <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2021/03/10389843/body-positivity-neutrality-movement-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-opted and made palatable</a> to their audience via white women.</p><p>What these data points can’t illustrate is that behind all the flash and glamour of being a Playmate of the Month and living in the Playboy Mansion, these women are like any of us.
